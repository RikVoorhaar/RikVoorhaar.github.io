## Research

Currently I'm working with Bart Vandereycken on low rank methods in tensor networks. Specifically
I'm exploring the relationship between Tensor Train / MPS networks and random forests. It seems that
tensor train networks can be used to define a general-purpose regressor that has similar properties
to random forests. I'm using Riemannian methods to optimize them, and I'm trying to keep all my code
backend agnostic so anyone can use it. 

Before that, I was trying to develop methods to compress MERA networks using Riemannian
optimization methods. Unfortunately this didn't work as well as expected. It turns out to be very
hard to compress tensor networks with loops.

Still before that, I worked with Pavol Ševera on deformation quantization of Poisson-Lie principal
bundles. The idea there is to combine the quantization of Poisson-Lie groups and of Poisson
bivectors to quantize a bundle over a Poisson manifold with Poisson-Lie structure group into a
Hopf-Galois extension of the quantized Lie bialgebra.

## Publications

[A computer algorithm for the BGG resolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021869320305135) November 2019, joint work with Nicolas Hemelsoet  
_Accepted to the Journal of Algebra_
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><sup> In this work we descibe an algorithm to compute the BGG resolution for modules over a simple Lie algebra. This is then used to compute various thing like the Hochschild cohomology of some flag varietes.</sup></li>
</ul>

[Parallel 2-transport and 2-group torsors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10060) October 2018
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><sup>This work is a continuation of my masters thesis. The idea is to study
  a toy model of principal 2-bundles and 2-transport by restricting to a stricter notion, where the fibers are all strict 2-groups.
  This allows to get some nice generalizations of the classical theory, which would
  be harder to proof with the more useful notions weaker notions.</sup></li>
</ul>

[Higher Gauge Theory](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/361953) February 2018 (Master thesis)

## Open source contributions

[bgg-cohomology sage package](https://github.com/RikVoorhaar/bgg-cohomology)
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><sup>I wrote a Sagemath package used for computing the BGG resolution of simple Lie algebra modules and the associated cohomology. </sup></li>
</ul>

[geoopt](https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt)
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><sup>This is a package for Riemannian optimization using PyTorch. I added a Riemannian line search and conjugate gradient optimizer to this project. </sup></li>
</ul>
