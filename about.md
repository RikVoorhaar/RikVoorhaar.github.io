Besides being a math student, it turns out I'm actually a person!

## Interests

### Music

Music is a big part of my life! I like almost any kind of rock music, but I tend to gravitate
towards heavier and noisier genres. Check out my [last.fm page](https://www.last.fm/user/Tilpo)
and my [rym page](https://rateyourmusic.com/~Tilpo)!

I like to play electric guitar. I have Japanese made Fender "Aerodyne" strat, and an Epiphone
Les Paul model (tuned to drop Bâ™­!). I also have more pairs of headphones than I can count...

### Gaming

I really enjoy playing open world (both RPG and survivalcraft) games, the feeling of freedom,
exploration  and creativity is wonderful. I also really enjoy replaying old (Nintendo) games from
my youth. I'm very enthuisiastic about speedrunning and its wonderful community. It feels
like taking the scientific approach to gaming.

### Cooking

I love cooking and the sense of satisfaction that comes with eating food you made yourself.
I don't shy away from any cuisine, and I'm constantly trying to improve and learn new things.

### Reading

I like to read hard sci-fi books, some of my favorite series are The Expanse (Corey), Foundation
(Asimov), The Bobiverse (Taylor) and Old Man's War (Scalzi). I'm also a big fan of the books of
Murakami. I also like to read fantasy books, and I recently came around to reading the Lord of the
Rings. As of writing, I'm reading the Stormlight Archive series by Sanderson, which is a long, epic,
fantasy series. Check out [my goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62542056-tilpo)
