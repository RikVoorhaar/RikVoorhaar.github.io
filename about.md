Besides being a math student, it turns out I'm actually a person!

## Interests

### Music

Music is a big part of my life! I like almost any kind of rock music, but I tend to gravitate
towards heavier and noisier genres. Check out my [last.fm page](https://www.last.fm/user/Tilpo)
and my [rym page](https://rateyourmusic.com/~Tilpo)!

I like to play electric guitar. I have Japanese made Fender "Aerodyne" strat, and an Epiphone
Les Paul model (tuned to drop Bâ™­!). I also have more pairs of headphones than I can count...

### Gaming

I really enjoy playing open world (both RPG and survivalcraft) games, the feeling of freedom,
exploration  and creativity is wonderful. I also really enjoy replaying old Nintendo games from
my youth. I'm also very enthuisiastic about speedrunning and its wonderful community. It feels
like taking the scientific approach to gaming.

### Cooking

I love cooking and the sense of satisfaction that comes with eating food you made yourself.
I don't shy away from any cuisine, and I'm constantly trying to improve and learn new things.
